# NASA Power of 10 Coding Rules

Please follow these NASA safety-critical guidelines whenever generating code:

1. **Keep control flow simple**  
   Avoid complex flows like `goto`, recursion, and function pointers if possible.

2. **Bound all loops**  
   No loop should run endlessly. Always specify clear, finite limits.

3. **No dynamic allocation after initialisation**  
   Allocate everything needed at the start, then avoid further memory allocation calls.

4. **Keep functions short**  
   Try to keep each function small (roughly 60 lines or fewer).

5. **Limit cyclomatic complexity**  
   Keep complexity below 10 if you can.

6. **Restrict pointer usage**  
   Avoid multiple levels of indirection. Aim for only a single `*` if required.

7. **No direct or indirect recursion**  
   Use iterative solutions for reliability and clarity.

8. **Validate data and return values**  
   Always check inputs, function returns, and data bounds.

9. **Enforce strict type checks**  
   Use strong or static typing to avoid inadvertent type mixing.

10. **Handle all errors**  
   Detect and handle every failure case in a controlled way.
